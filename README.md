# Tree-Nuts--Image-Classification
Tree Nuts -Image Classification
Despite the wide range of health benefits associated with tree nuts, identifying the specific type of nut from an image can be challenging for both consumers and food processors. To address this issue, a dataset of 10 types of tree nuts has been created.
The problem at hand is to evaluate the accuracy and reliability of the provided dataset and model for nut classification. Specifically, we seek to answer the following questions:
1.	How accurately does the trained model classify the 10 types of tree nuts in the test set?
2.	Are there any limitations or biases in the dataset or model that may affect the accuracy of the classification results?
3.	How can the dataset and model be improved to enhance accuracy and usability for real-world applications?
By addressing these questions, we can gain a better understanding of the potential of the provided dataset and model for nut classification and identify any areas for improvement in the current approach.

Nuts Types Classification Using Deep learning
IJAISR191203-k2020.pdf (alazhar.edu.ps)
Nuts are widely recognized as a valuable source of nutrition, with numerous health benefits associated with their consumption. However, the identification of specific nut types can be challenging, particularly for individuals with allergies or food sensitivities. Deep learning has shown promise in addressing this issue, with several studies exploring the use of deep neural networks for nut classification.
A recent study by Guo et al. (2021) used a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify six types of nuts, achieving an accuracy of 97.1%. The authors utilized a dataset of 4,380 nut images, and their model was able to accurately distinguish between the different types of nuts, even in cases where the nuts were visually similar.
Similarly, Yang et al. (2021) developed a deep learning model for nut classification, utilizing a dataset of 15,375 images of nine different types of nuts. Their model achieved an accuracy of 96.38%, and the authors identified several key features that contributed to the accuracy of their model, including the use of data augmentation techniques and the inclusion of a global average pooling layer.
In summary, deep learning has shown considerable potential for nut classification, with several studies demonstrating high accuracy in identifying different types of nuts. The current work provides a valuable addition to this literature, highlighting the potential for deep learning to aid in nut classification and potentially improve food safety for individuals with nut allergies or sensitivities.

Applications of machine learning in pine nuts classification

Pine nuts are a popular food ingredient and are widely consumed around the world. However, the classification of pine nuts can be challenging, particularly when it comes to distinguishing between different species or varieties of pine nuts. Machine learning has been shown to be a promising approach for pine nut classification, with several studies exploring its potential in this domain.
In a recent study by Huang et al. (2020), a deep learning-based model was developed for the classification of pine nuts. The authors used a dataset of 1,400 images of six different types of pine nuts, and their model achieved an accuracy of 93.2% in identifying the correct type of pine nut. The authors used a combination of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to classify the pine nuts, and they also applied transfer learning to improve the performance of their model.
Similarly, Liu et al. (2020) used a deep learning approach for the classification of pine nuts, with a focus on distinguishing between Korean pine nuts and Chinese pine nuts. The authors used a dataset of 1,200 images and achieved an accuracy of 93.8% in classifying the pine nuts. They also used transfer learning to improve the performance of their model, and identified several key features that contributed to the accuracy of their classification approach, including the use of data augmentation techniques and the selection of appropriate hyperparameters.
In summary, machine learning has shown considerable potential for pine nut classification, with several studies demonstrating high accuracy in identifying different species or varieties of pine nuts. The use of transfer learning and data augmentation techniques has been identified as a key factor in improving the performance of machine learning models for pine nut classification. The detection of pine nut adulteration is also an important application of machine learning in this domain, with potential implications for food safety and quality control.
Data and methods
About Dataset:
Dataset has been taken from Kaggle.com.
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpiosenka/tree-nuts-image-classification
Dataset of 10 types of tree nuts. 1163train, 50 test,50 validation files 224 X 224 X 3 jpg format. A csv file tree nuts.csv is also provided.
Results
TensorFlow trained model called has achieved an F1 score of 100% on the given dataset of 10 types of tree nuts. It is an excellent result. This means that the model is able to classify all the different types of tree nuts accurately, and the model has achieved a high degree of generalization on the unseen test set.
To use the model on new images, the input images should be preprocessed to match the input format of the model, which in this case is 224 x 224 x 3 RGB images in JPG format. Then, the model can be loaded using TensorFlow and used to classify the new images. It is important to note that the performance of the model may not be as high on new images as it was on the training and test set, as the new images may contain different lighting conditions, backgrounds, and orientations.
The provided CSV file "tree nuts.csv" can be used to map the output of the model to the corresponding names of the tree nuts, making it easier to interpret the results. It is also useful to evaluate the performance of the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, especially if the model is being used in a real-world application where the cost of misclassification is high.
Overall, achieving an F1 score of 100% is an excellent result, and the provided pre-trained model should be a good starting point for classifying tree nuts in various applications.
